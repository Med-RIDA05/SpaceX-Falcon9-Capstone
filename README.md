# SpaceX Falcon 9 Landing Prediction – Data Science Capstone

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate – Capstone Project**.  
The objective is to analyze historical SpaceX Falcon 9 launch data and build a machine learning model to predict whether the **first stage will land successfully**.

Successful landings allow SpaceX to reuse rocket boosters, significantly reducing launch costs.
